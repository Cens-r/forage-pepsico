# forage-pepsico
The purpose of this repository is to document my progress through the PepsiCo job simulation on Forage.

## Tasks

### Task 1 | High-Level Design
The high-level design of the Augur system was made using [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net), and is used to visualize the system as a whole.
This diagram showcases interactions, on a service level, between all parts of the Augur system as conveyed by the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) requirements.

### Task 2 | System Breakdown
Trello was used to hold the engineering tickets I created to describe the high-level design for the Augur system.
These tickets help articulate the system in words, such that engineers can make sense of each part of the system.
Using Trello allows the progress of these individual pieces to be shared and tracked in a centralized place, in a Kanban format.
